# 🎮 Avalanche Arcade  

Avalanche Arcade is a **Web3 gaming hub** where players can enjoy multiple arcade-style games, earn rewards, and trade in-game assets.  
The platform uses **AVAX** and **DT (Arcade Token)** for gameplay, rewards, and marketplace interactions.  
Each game supports **NFT-based collectibles** powered by an **ERC-1155 smart contract**, along with a **DT ERC-20 token** for in-game economy.

## 📜 Smart Contract Overview

### 1️⃣ DT Token (ERC-20)
- Minted when players buy with AVAX.  
- Used for gameplay entry fees, marketplace trades, and rewards.  
- Example functions:  
  - `buyDT()` – Swap AVAX → DT  
  - `redeemDT()` – Convert DT back to AVAX  
  - `balanceOf(address)` – Check balance  

### 2️⃣ Game Assets (ERC-1155)
- NFT assets linked to each game.  
- Unique IDs for games:  
  - `1` → Dragon Runner  
  - `2` → Road Rivals  
  - `3` → Snake Game  
  - `4` → Wall Ball  
- Example functions:  
  - `mintAsset(address, id, amount)`  
  - `burnAsset(address, id, amount)`  
  - `marketplaceBuy(uint256 id, uint256 priceInDT)`

## 🎮 How It Works In-Game

1. Player connects wallet.
2. Player buys DT tokens with AVAX.
3. Player chooses a game (Dragon Runner, Road Rivals, Snake, Wall Ball).
4. Entry fee (DT) is deducted → gameplay starts.
5. Based on score/performance, rewards are distributed:

   * DT tokens
   * NFT rewards (ERC-1155)
6. Leaderboard updates score.
7. NFTs & tokens can be traded in Marketplace.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## 🔮 Future Plans

* Seasonal tournaments with unique NFT rewards.
* Mobile app version.
* Cross-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon).
* NFT staking for in-game perks.
